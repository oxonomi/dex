            <h2>Thanks for taking the time to explore my demo decentralized exchange!</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
            I hope it has given you a taste of my passion for blockchain technology and has showcased my skills as a smart contract and front-end developer.<br />
            Having engaged in multiple courses and hands on practice, building and experimenting with smart contracts, this project brings many aspects together in a live environment.
            </p>
            <br />
            I am currently open to opportunities where I can apply these skills and continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in the blockchain space. My passion for design and development, combined with my professional experience in leading roles of system administration and project management, has positioned me at the intersect of technical development and business execution. I'm just as comfortable with a team of engineers, as I am in the boardroom or face-to-face with clients. <br /><br />
            If you're working on a challenging project, and are in search of someone committed to fostering transformative change, don't hesitate to send me an email so we can arrange a call and make things happen.<br />
