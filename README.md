This app is a decentralised cryptocurrency token exchange similar to UniSwap and PancakeSwap.
It is a fully functional demo running on testnets, intended to showcase smart contract functionality. It is not a production version.

- Pick a testnet; Hardhart(ETH), Sepolia(ETH), Mumbai(MATIC)
- Connect your MetaMask wallet
- Use the token smart contract faucet function to receive OXO and GBPc tokens.
- Use the Deposit function to move tokens from your MetaMask wallet to the exchange smart contract.
- View Price Chart and Order Book of existing trades.
- Fill the order of another user, Taking the trade.
- Create your own order for others to fill, Making the trade.
- View your transaction history and open orders
- Withdraw your tokens from the exchange smart contract back to your MetaMask wallet

I hope it has given you a taste of my passion for blockchain technology and has showcased my skills as a smart contract and front-end developer.
I am currently open to opportunities where I can apply these skills and continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in the blockchain space.
